agency-regions
==============

This is a collection of data about how federal agencies divide their agency coverage geospatially.

The reason why this was created is because feederal agencies have different regional divisions and naming conventions. This is an attempt to codify these variations.

Initially, the ```region-maps``` folder will be populated with images of the regional maps. The ```region_maps.csv``` is file of basic info where that piece of information was acquired.

Initially, much of the work will be manually curation. Please execuse the mess.
